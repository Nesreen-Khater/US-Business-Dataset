# US Business Sales Analysis  (Power BI)

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of **Sales** and **Profit** across US states using Power BI.  
The work included **data cleaning**, **data modeling**, building a **Date Dimension**, and creating advanced **DAX measures** for KPIs such as YTD, QTD, MTD, MoM %, and YoY %.  

I designed **six interactive dashboards** with drill-through and navigation to deliver a complete reporting solution.
